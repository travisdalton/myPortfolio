                    <p>I'm a full-stack developer with a
                        knack for problem-solving and an obsession with golf.</p>
                <p>I love coding because I get a charge out of
                        the problem solving aspect of coding and I am able to put
                        some creativity into my work when building a page.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, I can be found golfing, cooking a meal for my wife,
                        preparing my house for my first child, or walking my dog.</p>
                <p>Please feel free to reach out - I would love to hear from you!

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I was born in Pawtucket, RI and grew up moving fairly frequently 
                        until landing in the Valley Forge/Wayne, Pennsylvania for the latter part of my
                        youth and most of my young adult life.  I later attended the University of Delaware.
                        This was followed by an assortment of work experiences and eventually I wound up 
                        attending Suffolk University Law School in Boston.</p>
                    <p>In the years following law school, I worked an assortment of jobs before landing in
                        my current role where I learned I had an interest in technology - specifically development
                        and coding.</p>
                    <p>On a personal front, my wife Marissa and I married in September of 2019 and 
                        we are expecting our first child in April 2020.  Fittingly it's on Masters Sunday - the greatest
                        Sunday of the year.</p>
                    <p>I didn’t think the upcoming birth of my first child was going to be enough work, 
                        so I decided that it was the right time to learn how to code and enrolled in Bloc.
                        I find coding and development to be 
                        fascinating and extremely rewarding.  It is essentially solving one 
                        problem after the next.  Law school helped me develop the ability to break 
                        big problems down into smaller problems.  Once you’ve solved all of those 
                        smaller problems, the solution falls into place for the big 
                        problem.  It’s like putting together a puzzle and I get a real charge out of 
                        it. I look forward to my next adventure in development.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for reading a bit about me.  Please feel free to get in touch!</p>
