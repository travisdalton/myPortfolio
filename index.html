            <h2>About me...</h2>
            <p>I'm a full-stack developer with a
                 knack for problem-solving and an obsession with golf.</p>
            <p>I love coding because I get a charge out of
                the problem solving aspect of coding and I am able to put
                 some creativity into my work when building a page.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I can be found golfing, cooking a meal,
                preparing my house for my first child, or walking my dog.</p>
            <p>Please feel free to reach out - I would love to hear from you!
